# Simple Demo of Linear Regression

The `main1.py` script demonstrates linear regression in a one-dimensional-feature context, while `main2.py` handles linear regression in a multi-dimensional-feature setting (specifically, two dimensions in this demo). Both scripts include visualizations to effectively illustrate the results.
